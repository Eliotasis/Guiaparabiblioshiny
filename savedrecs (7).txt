AB Different types of mutualisms may interact, co-evolve and form complex
AB networks of interdependences, but how species interact in networks of a
AB mutualistic community and maintain its stability remains unclear. In a
AB mutualistic network between treehoppers-weaver ants and fig-pollinating
AB wasps, we found that the cuticular hydrocarbons of the treehoppers are
AB more similar to the surface chemical profiles of fig inflorescence
AB branches (FIB) than the cuticular hydrocarbons of the fig wasps.
AB Behavioral assays showed that the cuticular hydrocarbons from both
AB treehoppers and FIBs reduce the propensity of weaver ants to attack
AB treehoppers even in the absence of honeydew rewards, suggesting that
AB chemical camouflage helps enforce the mutualism between weaver ants and
AB treehoppers. High levels of weaver ant and treehopper abundances help
AB maintain the dominance of pollinating fig wasps in the fig wasp
AB community and also increase fig seed production, as a result of
AB discriminative predation and disturbance by weaver ants of ovipositing
AB non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs). Ants therefore help preserve this
AB fig-pollinating wasp mutualism from over exploitation by NPFWs. Our
AB results imply that in this mutualistic network chemical camouflage plays
AB a decisive role in regulating the behavior of a key species and
AB indirectly shaping the architecture of complex arthropod-plant
AB interactions.
