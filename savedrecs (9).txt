AB Different types of mutualisms may interact, co-evolve and form complex
   networks of interdependences, but how species interact in networks of a
   mutualistic community and maintain its stability remains unclear. In a
   mutualistic network between treehoppers-weaver ants and fig-pollinating
   wasps, we found that the cuticular hydrocarbons of the treehoppers are
   more similar to the surface chemical profiles of fig inflorescence
   branches (FIB) than the cuticular hydrocarbons of the fig wasps.
   Behavioral assays showed that the cuticular hydrocarbons from both
   treehoppers and FIBs reduce the propensity of weaver ants to attack
   treehoppers even in the absence of honeydew rewards, suggesting that
   chemical camouflage helps enforce the mutualism between weaver ants and
   treehoppers. High levels of weaver ant and treehopper abundances help
   maintain the dominance of pollinating fig wasps in the fig wasp
   community and also increase fig seed production, as a result of
   discriminative predation and disturbance by weaver ants of ovipositing
   non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs). Ants therefore help preserve this
   fig-pollinating wasp mutualism from over exploitation by NPFWs. Our
   results imply that in this mutualistic network chemical camouflage plays
   a decisive role in regulating the behavior of a key species and
   indirectly shaping the architecture of complex arthropod-plant
   interactions.

AB Changing conditions may lead to sudden shifts in the state of ecosystems
   when critical thresholds are passed. Some well-studied drivers of such
   transitions lead to predictable outcomes such as a turbid lake or a
   degraded landscape. Many ecosystems are, however, complex systems of
   many interacting species. While detecting upcoming transitions in such
   systems is challenging, predicting what comes after a critical
   transition is terra incognita altogether. The problem is that complex
   ecosystems may shift to many different, alternative states. Whether an
   impending transition has minor, positive or catastrophic effects is thus
   unclear. Some systems may, however, behave more predictably than others.
   The dynamics of mutualistic communities can be expected to be relatively
   simple, because delayed negative feedbacks leading to oscillatory or
   other complex dynamics are weak. Here, we address the question of
   whether this relative simplicity allows us to foresee a community's
   future state. As a case study, we use a model of a bipartite mutualistic
   network and show that a network's post-transition state is indicated by
   the way in which a system recovers from minor disturbances. Similar
   results obtained with a unipartite model of facilitation suggest that
   our results are of relevance to a wide range of mutualistic systems.

AB Research on the relationship between the architecture of ecological
   networks and community stability has mainly focused on one type of
   interaction at a time, making difficult any comparison between different
   network types. We used a theoretical approach to show that the network
   architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic
   and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture
   promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the
   stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly
   connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by
   a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real
   pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude
   that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns
   constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending
   on the type of interaction.

AB We study how the community structure of bipartite mutualistic networks
   changes in a dynamic context. First, we consider a real mutualistic
   network and introduce extinction events according to several scenarios.
   We model extinctions as node or interaction removals. For node removal,
   we consider random, directed and sequential extinctions; for interaction
   removal, we consider random extinctions. The bipartite network
   reorganizes showing an increase of the effective modularity and a fast
   decrease of the persistence of the species in the original communities
   with increasing number of extinction events. Second, we compare
   extinctions in a real mutualistic network with the growth of a bipartite
   network model. The modularity reaches a stationary value and nodes
   remain in the same community after joining the network. Our results show
   that perturbations and disruptive events affect the connectivity pattern
   of mutualistic networks at the mesoscale level. The increase of the
   effective modularity observed in some scenarios could provide some
   protection to the remaining ecosystem.

AB Mutualistic networks are considered an example of resilience against
   perturbations. Mutualistic interactions are beneficial for the two sets
   of species involved. Network robustness has been usually measured in
   terms of extinction sequences, i.e., nodes are removed from the
   empirical bipartite network one subset (primary extinctions) and the
   number of extinctions on the other subset (secondary extinction) is
   computed. This is a first approach to study ecosystems extinction.
   However, each interacting species, depicted as a node of the mutualistic
   network, is really composed by certain number of individuals
   (population) and its shortage can diminish dramatically the population
   of its interacting partners, i.e. the population dynamics plays an
   important role in the robustness of the ecological networks. Although
   different models of population dynamics for mutualistic interacting
   species have been addressed, like Type II models, only recently a new
   mutualistic model has been proposed exhibiting bounded solutions and
   good properties for simulation. In this paper we show that population
   dynamics is as important as network topology when we are interested in
   the resilience of the community.

AB Nested architecture is distinctive in plant-animal mutualistic networks.
   However, to date an integrative and quantitative explanation has been
   lacking. It is evident that species often switch their interactive
   partners in real-world mutualistic networks such as pollination and
   seed-dispersal networks. By incorporating an interaction switch into a
   novel multi-population model, we show that the nested architecture
   rapidly emerges from an initially random network. The model allowing
   interaction switches between partner species produced predictions which
   fit remarkably well with observations from 81 empirical networks. Thus,
   the nested architecture in mutualistic networks could be an intrinsic
   physical structure of dynamic networks and the interaction switch is
   likely a key ecological process that results in nestedness of real-world
   networks. Identifying the biological processes responsible for network
   structures is thus crucial for understanding the architecture of
   ecological networks.

AB Multiple classes of interactions may exist affecting one another in a
   given system. For the mutualistic networks of plants and pollinating
   animals, it has been known that the degree distribution is broad but
   often deviates from power-law form more significantly for plants than
   animals. To illuminate the origin of such asymmetry, we study a model
   network in which links are assigned under generalized
   preferential-selection rules between two groups of nodes and find the
   sensitive dependence of the resulting connectivity pattern on the model
   parameters. The nonlinearity of preferential selection can come from
   interspecific interactions among animals and among plants. The
   model-based analysis of real-world mutualistic networks suggests that a
   new animal determines its partners not only by their abundance but also
   under the competition with existing animal species, which leads to the
   stretched-exponential degree distributions of plants.

AB Distinct relationships such as activation, inhibition, cooperation, and
   competition are not established independently but in a correlated manner
   in complex systems. Thus the patterns of one type of interaction may
   reflect the impacts of other classes of interactions, but its
   quantitative understanding remains to be done. Referring to the
   plant-pollinator mutualistic networks, here we propose and investigate
   the structural features of a model bipartite network, in which the
   mutualistic relationship between two different types of nodes is
   established under the influence of the compatibility among the nodes of
   the same type. Interestingly, we find that the degree distributions
   obtained for extremely broad compatibility distributions are similar to
   those for a constant compatibility, both of which deviate from those for
   the Gaussian compatibility distributions. We present the analytic
   arguments to explain this finding. Also the dependence of the
   topological similarity of two nodes on their compatibility is
   illustrated. We discuss the application of our findings to complex

AB Mutualistic networks, which describe the ecological interactions between
   multiple types of species such as plants and pollinators, play a
   paramount role in the generation of Earth's biodiversity. The resilience
   of a mutualistic network denotes its ability to retain basic
   functionality when errors and failures threaten the persistence of the
   community. Under the disturbances of mass extinctions and human-induced
   disasters, it is crucial to understand how mutualistic networks respond
   to changes, which enables the system to increase resilience and tolerate
   further damages. Despite recent advances in the modelling of the
   structure-based adaptation, we lack mathematical and computational
   models to describe and capture the co-adaptation between the structure
   and dynamics of mutualistic networks. In this paper, we incorporate
   dynamic features into the adaptation of structure and propose a
   co-adaptation model that drastically enhances the resilience of
   non-adaptive and structure-based adaptation models. Surprisingly, the
   reason for the enhancement is that the co-adaptation mechanism
   simultaneously increases the heterogeneity of the mutualistic network
   significantly without changing its connectance. Owing to the broad
   applications of mutualistic networks, our findings offer new ways to
   design mechanisms that enhance the resilience of many other systems,
   such as smart infrastructures and social-economical systems.

AB Plant-animal mutualistic networks can be described as bipartite graphs
   depicting the interactions between two distinct sets: plants and
   animals. These mutualistic networks have been found to be highly
   structured. Specifically, they show a nested pattern in which
   specialists interact with proper subsets of the set of species with
   which generalists interact. This pattern is important for understanding
   coevolution in species-rich communities, which can be reduced neither to
   pairs of coevolving species nor to diffuse, randomly interacting
   assemblages. We discuss the dynamic implications of network structure
   from the points of view of coevolution, community ecology, and

AB 1. Incorporating interactions into a biogeographical framework may serve
   to understand how interactions and the services they provide are
   distributed in space. We begin by simulating the spatiotemporal dynamics
   of realistic mutualistic networks inhabiting spatial networks of habitat
   patches. We proceed by comparing the predicted patterns with the
   empirical results of a set of pollination networks in isolated hills of
   the Argentinian Pampas. We first find that one needs to sample up to
   five times as much area to record interactions as would be needed to
   sample the same proportion of species. Secondly, we find that peripheral
   patches have fewer interactions and harbour less nested networks -
   therefore potentially less resilient communities - compared to central
   patches. Our results highlight the important role played by the
   structure of dispersal routes on the spatial distribution of community
   patterns. This may help to understand the formation of biodiversity hot
   spots.

AB Several network properties have been identified as determinants of the
   stability and complexity of mutualistic networks. However, it is unclear
   which mechanisms give rise to these network properties. Phenology seems
   important, because it shapes the topology of mutualistic networks, but
   its effects on the dynamics of mutualistic networks have scarcely been
   studied. Here, we study these effects with a general dynamical model of
   mutualistic and competitive interactions where the interaction strength
   depends on the temporal overlap between species resulting from their
   phenologies. We find a negative complexitystability relationship, where
   phenologies maximising mutualistic interactions and minimising
   intraguild competitive interactions generate speciose, nested and poorly
   connected networks with moderate asymmetry and low resilience. Moreover,
   lengthening the season increases diversity and resilience. This
   highlights the fragility of real mutualistic communities with short
   seasons (e.g. Arctic environments) to drastic environmental changes.

AB Generalist species are the linchpins of networks, as they are important
   for maintaining network structure and function. Previous studies have
   shown that interactions between generalists tend to occur consistently
   across years and sites. However, the link between temporal and spatial
   interaction persistence across scales remains unclear. To address this
   gap, we collected data on plant-pollinator interactions throughout the
   flowering period for 5 yr across six plots in a subalpine meadow in the
   Rocky Mountains. We found that interactions between generalists tended
   to persist more in time and space such that interactions near the
   network core were more frequently recorded across years, within seasons,
   and among plots. We posit that species' tolerance of environmental
   variation across time and space plays a key role in generalization by
   regulating spatiotemporal overlap with interaction partners. Our results
   imply a role of spatiotemporal environmental variation in organizing
   species interactions, marrying niche concepts that emphasize species
   environmental constraints and their community role.

AB Perturbations, such as fluctuations in abundance, can ripple across
   species assemblages through ecological interactions. Furthermore, the
   way in which ecological interactions are organized into a network and
   the interaction strengths connecting species may be important for
   cascading effects. Previous work revealed that network structure
   determines how cascading effects spread across species assemblages. A
   next step is to understand how interaction strengths influence cascading
   effects. Here, we assume that perturbations have negative effects, and
   we evaluate whether interaction strength affects network robustness to
   cascading effects in mutualistic interactions, and examine the role of
   network structure in mediating perturbation cascades when interaction
   strength is incorporated. We combine empirical data on 18 mutualistic
   networks, two simulations scenarios, and network theory, to investigate
   how network structure affects perturbation spreading time, a proxy of
   network robustness to cascading effects. Simulations in which we
   included interaction strength presented higher mean spreading time,
   indicating that interaction strength increases network robustness.
   Richness, modularity, and nestedness had a strong, positive effect, on
   mean perturbation spreading time regardless of the interaction
   strengths. We found that network structure and the distribution of
   interaction strengths affected communities' robustness to perturbation
   spreading. Our results contribute to the discussion on the danger that
   ecosystems face when species, and interactions alike, become extinct.

AB The architecture and properties of many complex networks play a
   significant role in the functioning of the systems they describe.
   Recently, complex network theory has been applied to ecological
   entities, like food webs or mutualistic plant-animal interactions.
   Unfortunately, we still lack an accurate view of the relationship
   between the architecture and functioning of ecological networks. In this
   study we explore this link by building individual-based pollination
   networks from eight Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae) populations.
   In these individual-based networks, each individual plant in a
   population was considered a node, and was connected by means of
   undirected links to conspecifics sharing pollinators. The architecture
   of these unipartite networks was described by means of nestedness,
   connectivity and transitivity. Network functioning was estimated by
   quantifying the performance of the population described by each network
   as the number of per-capita juvenile plants produced per population. We
   found a consistent relationship between the topology of the networks and
   their functioning, since variation across populations in the average
   per-capita production of juvenile plants was positively and
   significantly related with network nestedness, connectivity and
   clustering. Subtle changes in the composition of diverse pollinator
   assemblages can drive major consequences for plant population
   performance and local persistence through modifications in the structure
   of the inter-plant pollination networks.

AB Species roles in ecological networks combine to generate their
   architecture, which contributes to their stability. Species trait
   diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it
   remains unknown whether species' contributions to functional diversity
   relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen
   transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that,
   apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits
   either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a
   subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions
   to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche
   specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having
   unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners.
   Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially
   because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family
   level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight
   into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.

AB 1. Generalists are assumed to play a key role in structuring and
   stabilising animal-plant mutualistic networks. Until now, analyses on
   the effects of generalists have been based on empirical field data or
   simulations. The present natural field experiment manipulated the
   abundance of a generalist and abundant stingless bee [Melipona
   (Eomelipona) marginata] to determine the effects on the mutualistic
   network.
   2. Networks were generated, and associated metrics were used for
   comparing replicate plots with and without the insertion of stingless
   bee nests.
   3. Unweighted metrics and the basic qualitative structural pattern of
   networks (high nestedness, very low modularity and specialisation) was
   not affected by experimental variation in stingless bee abundance
   because they exert strong basal effects on the plant-pollinator
   community under natural conditions of abundance. Still, increased
   abundance caused significant variation in weighted nestedness and
   modularity and community-level specialisation.
   4. Supporting predictions of neutral models, increased abundance of the
   stingless bee led to an increase in most of its specific metrics,
   expressing the expansion of its realised trophic niche.
   5. During this process, specialist and other generalist bees were
   affected in different ways. More plant species became even more
   dependent on this stingless bee (increased asymmetry).
   6. Long-term effects could not be inferred directly from instantaneous
   values of network metrics. Nonetheless, the increased abundance of the
   generalist stingless bee may both reduce the local level of ecological
   specialisation in the short term and affect the spatial distribution of
   less abundant and/or specialist bee species and plants in the long term.

AB Current understanding of mutualistic networks is grounded largely in
   data on interaction frequency, yet mutualistic network dynamics are also
   shaped by interaction quality-the functional outcomes of individual
   interactions on reproduction and survival. The difficulty of obtaining
   data on functional outcomes has resulted in limited understanding of
   functional variation among a network's pairwise species interactions, of
   the study designs that are necessary to capture major sources of
   functional variation, and of predictors of functional variation that may
   allow generalization across networks. In this community-scale study, we
   targeted a key functional outcome in plant-frugivore networks: the
   impact of frugivore gut passage on seed germination. We used captive
   frugivore feeding trials and germination experiments in an island
   ecosystem, attaining species-level coverage across all extant native
   frugivores and the plants they consume to (a) assess sources of
   functional variation, (b) separate effects of pulp removal from those of
   scarification via gut passage, and (c) test trait-based correlates of
   gut passage effect sizes. We found antagonistic seed predation effects
   of a frugivore previously assumed to be a seed disperser, highlighting
   the need to consider functional outcomes rather than interaction
   frequency alone. The other frugivores each exhibited similar impacts for
   individual plant species, with benefits primarily caused by pulp removal
   rather than scarification, supporting the use of animal functional
   groups in this context. In contrast, plant species varied widely in
   impacts of gut passage on germination. Species with smaller seeds and
   more frugivore partners had larger benefits of gut passage, showing
   promise for network metrics and functional traits to predict functional
   variation among plants. Synthesis. Combining network and demographic
   approaches, we assessed the degree and sources of variation in a key
   functional outcome of plant-frugivore interactions across an entire
   network. Using a detailed study design, our work shows how simpler study
   designs can capture primary sources of functional variation and that
   functional traits and network metrics may allow generalization across
   networks. Efficiently measuring and generalizing sources of functional
   variation within mutualistic networks will strengthen our ability to
   model network dynamics and predict mutualist responses to global change.

AB We analyzed the structure of a multispecific network or interacting ants
   and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries recorded in 1990 and again in
   2000 in La Mancha, Veracruz, Mexico. We assessed the replicability of
   the number of interactions found among species and also whether there
   had been changes in the network structure associated with appearance of
   new ant and plant species during. that 10-year period. Our results show
   that the nested topology of the network was similar between sampling
   dates, group dissimilarity increased, mean number of interactions for
   ant species increased, the frequency distribution of standardized
   degrees reached higher values for plant species, more ant species and
   fewer plant species constituted the core of the more recent network, and
   the presence of new ant and plant species increased while their
   contribution to nestedness remained the same. Generalist species (i.e.,
   those with the most links or interactions) appeared to maintain the
   stability of the network because the new species incorporated into the
   communities were linked to this core of generalists. Camponotus planatus
   was the most extreme generalist ant species (the one with the most
   links) in both networks, followed by four other ant species; but other
   species changed either their position along the continuum of generalists
   relative to specialists or their presence or absence within the network.
   Even though new species moved into the area during the decade between
   the surveys, the overall network structure remained unmodified.

AB Ecological interactions are highly dynamic in time and space. Previous
   studies of plant-animal mutualistic networks have shown that the
   occurrence of interactions varies substantially across years. We
   analyzed interannual variation of a quantitative mutualistic network, in
   which links are weighted by interaction frequency. The network was
   sampled over six consecutive years, representing one of the longest time
   series for a community-wide mutualistic network. We estimated the
   interannual similarity in interactions and assessed the determinants of
   their persistence. The occurrence of interactions varied greatly among
   years, with most interactions seen in only one year (64%) and few (20%)
   in more than two years. This variation was associated with the frequency
   and position of interactions relative to the network core, so that the
   network consisted of a persistent core of frequent interactions and many
   peripheral, infrequent interactions. Null model analyses suggest that
   species abundances play a substantial role in generating these patterns.
   Our study represents an important step in the study of ecological
   networks, furthering our mechanistic understanding of the ecological
   processes driving the temporal persistence of interactions.

AB Ecological networks exhibit non-random structural patterns, such as
   modularity and nestedness, which determine ecosystem stability with
   species diversity and connectance. Such structure-stability
   relationships are well known. However, another important perspective is
   less well understood: the relationship between the environment and
   structure. Inspired by theoretical studies that suggest that network
   structure can change due to environmental variability, we collected data
   on a number of empirical food webs and mutualistic networks and
   evaluated the effect of climatic seasonality on ecological network
   structure. As expected, we found that climatic seasonality affects
   ecological network structure. In particular, an increase in modularity
   due to climatic seasonality was observed in food webs; however, it is
   debatable whether this occurs in mutualistic networks. Interestingly,
   the type of climatic seasonality that affects network structure differs
   with ecosystem type. Rainfall and temperature seasonality influence
   freshwater food webs and mutualistic networks, respectively; food webs
   are smaller, and more modular, with increasing rainfall seasonality.
   Mutualistic networks exhibit a higher diversity (particularly of
   animals) with increasing temperature seasonality. These results confirm
   the theoretical prediction that the stability increases with greater
   perturbation. Although these results are still debatable because of
   several limitations in the data analysis, they may enhance our
   understanding of environment-structure relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   The plants and pollinators are linked by the plant-pollinating relation.
   We assigned the visiting frequency of pollinators to a plant as a weight
   of each link. We calculated the cumulative distribution functions of the
   degree and strength for the networks. We observed a power-law, linear,
   and stretched exponential dependence of the cumulative distribution
   function. We also calculated the disparity and the strength of the nodes
   s(k) with degree k. We observed that the plant-pollinator networks
   exhibit an disassortative behaviors and nonlinear dependence of the
   strength on the nodes. In mutualistic networks links with large weight
   are connected to the neighbors with small degrees.

AB The application of complex network theory to community ecology has
   enabled quantification of interactions among large suites of species and
   clarified patterns of community structure across systems. Past analyses,
   however, have assumed that ecological networks are temporally static and
   persistent and spatially homogeneous, which could confound inference if
   species interactions vary over time and space. To evaluate temporal and
   spatial variation in mutualistic networks, therefore, we evaluated the
   consistency of a nectarivory/pollination network across years, by
   season, and over space. We tracked nectaring interactions among 37
   butterfly and 58 flowering plant taxa during an 11-yr period
   (2007-2017), across each summer and over a grassland landscape in
   Pennsylvania, USA. The composition of butterflies, plants, and their
   interactions varied markedly across years, months, and sites. Despite
   this compositional variation, one metric of network structure,
   nestedness, was invariant, with interactions much more nested than
   random across all years, months, and sites. Together with previous
   studies, this result suggests ecological interaction networks are
   generally more nested than expected by chance. Other measures of network
   structure were more variable, especially over time. Numbers of plants
   and interactions varied by year, month, and site. Connectance and
   numbers of butterflies varied annually and seasonally. Temporal
   variation in specialization was also evident for some species at an
   annual level and for the community across the season. We further found
   highly stable species were almost always generalists, while highly
   specialized species were almost always temporally and spatially
   variable, with few exceptions. Together, these results suggest
   communities are comprised of a reliable core of generalist species,
   accompanied by a changing suite of specialist species that, when
   participating in the network, primarily interact with the reliable core
   species. Our finding of nested mutualistic network centered on
   stable-generalist species accompanied by a changing suite of sporadic
   specialists indicates dynamic changes in ecological communities vary
   with topological position. This finding further suggests that, even as
   rare species are highly threatened by species invasion, climate change,
   and other anthropogenic perturbations, network structure may be robust
   to species loss and compositional change from these perturbations.

AB It is theorized that a mutualistic ecosystem's resilience against
   perturbations (e.g. species extinction) is determined by a single
   macroscopic parameter (network resilience), calculable from the network.
   Given that such perturbations occur owing to environmental changes (e.g.
   climate change and human impact), it has been predicted that mutualistic
   ecosystems that exist despite extensive environmental changes exhibit
   higher network resilience; however, such a prediction has not been
   confirmed using real-world data. Thus, in this study, the effects of
   climate change velocity and human activities on mutualistic network
   resilience were investigated. A global dataset of plant-animal
   mutualistic networks was used, and spatial analysis was performed to
   examine the effects. Moreover, the potential confounding effects of
   network size, current climate and altitude were statistically
   controlled. It was demonstrated that mutualistic network resilience was
   globally influenced by warming velocity and human impact, in addition to
   current climate. Specifically, pollination network resilience increased
   in response to human impact, and seed-dispersal network resilience
   increased with warming velocity. The effect of environmental changes on
   network resilience for plants was remarkable. The results confirmed the
   prediction obtained based on the theory and imply that real-world
   mutualistic networks have a structure that increases ecosystem
   resilience against environmental changes. These findings will enhance
   the understanding of ecosystem resilience.

AB In habitats after natural disturbance, mutualistic interaction between
   plant and flower-visiting insects is critical for maintenance and
   recovery of communities. However, the detailed characteristics of the
   plant-insect interactions that occur after a natural disturbance remain
   to be identified. We investigated the network structure of these
   interactions on the oceanic and volcanic island of Miyake, Japan. Large
   vegetated areas of this island were disturbed by a massive volcanic
   eruption during 2000. In 2012, we sampled insects visiting the flowering
   plants along the roadsides bordering six sites in the 3 vegetation
   types, which represent the island's vegetation after the volcanic
   disturbance; (1) shrubland colonizing accumulated ash (SL), (2) mature
   broad-leaved forests with partial damage (BF), and (3) coastal
   vegetation with partial damage (CV). Network properties, such as
   specialization, nestedness, and modularity did not differ among the
   three vegetation categories. We found the same specialized, modular, and
   anti-nested structures in five networks. The largest variation in
   insect/plant assemblages was observed between CV and the other
   vegetation types, but we did not find distinctive variations between SL
   and BF sites. Our study suggests that network structure is constant in
   the varying vegetation types, and raises the possibility that this
   island's mutualistic interactions are robust to volcanic disturbance.

AB Analysis of ecological networks is a valuable approach to understanding
   the vulnerability of systems to disturbance. The tolerance of ecological
   networks to coextinctions, resulting from sequences of primary
   extinctions (here termed "knockout extinction models", in contrast with
   other dynamic approaches), is a widely used tool for modeling network
   "robustness". Currently, there is an emphasis to increase biological
   realism in these models, but less attention has been given to the effect
   of model choices and network structure on robustness measures. Here, we
   present a suite of knockout extinction models for bipartite ecological
   networks (specifically plant-pollinator networks) that can all be
   analyzed on the same terms, enabling us to test the effects of
   extinction rules, interaction weights, and network structure on
   robustness. We include two simple ecologically plausible models of
   propagating extinctions, one new and one adapted from existing models.
   All models can be used with weighted or binary interaction data. We
   found that the choice of extinction rules impacts robustness; our two
   propagating models produce opposing effects in all tests on observed
   plant-pollinator networks. Adding weights to the interactions tends to
   amplify the opposing effects and increase the variation in robustness.
   Variation in robustness is a key feature of these extinction models and
   is driven by the structural heterogeneity of nodes (specifically, the
   skewness of the plant degree distribution) in the network. Our analysis
   therefore reveals the mechanisms and fundamental network properties that
   drive observed trends in robustness.

AB Despite recognition of key biotic processes in shaping the structure of
   biological communities, few empirical studies have explored the
   influences of abiotic factors on the structural properties of
   mutualistic networks. We tested whether temperature and precipitation
   contribute to temporal variation in the nestedness of mutualistic
   ant-plant networks. While maintaining their nested structure, nestedness
   increased with mean monthly precipitation and, particularly, with
   monthly temperature. Moreover, some species changed their role in
   network structure, shifting from peripheral to core species within the
   nested network. We could summarize that abiotic factors affect plant
   species in the vegetation (e.g., phenology), meaning presence/absence of
   food sources, consequently an increase/decrease of associations with
   ants, and finally, these variations to fluctuations in nestedness. While
   biotic factors are certainly important, greater attention needs to be
   given to abiotic factors as underlying determinants of the structures of
   ecological networks.

AB Background. Ecological communities are dynamic collections whose
   composition and structure change over time, making up complex
   interspecific interaction networks. Mutualistic plant-animal networks
   can be approached through complex network analysis; these networks are
   characterized by a nested structure consisting of a core of generalist
   species, which endows the network with stability and robustness against
   disturbance. Those mutualistic network structures can vary as a
   consequence of seasonal fluctuations and food availability, as well as
   the arrival of new species into the system that might disorder the
   mutualistic network structure (e.g., a decrease in nested pattern).
   However, there is no assessment on how the arrival of migratory species
   into seasonal tropical systems can modify such patterns. Emergent and
   fine structural temporal patterns are adressed here for the first time
   for plant-frugivorous bird networks in a highly seasonal tropical
   environment.
   Methods. In a plant-frugivorous bird community, we analyzed the temporal
   turnover of bird species comprising the network core and periphery of
   ten temporal interaction networks resulting from different bird
   migration periods. Additionally, we evaluated how fruit abundance and
   richness, as well as the arrival of migratory birds into the system,
   explained the temporal changes in network parameters such as network
   size, connectance, nestedness, specialization, interaction strength
   asymmetry and niche overlap. The analysis included data from 10
   quantitative plant-frugivorous bird networks registered from November
   2013 to November 2014.
   Results. We registered a total of 319 interactions between 42 plant
   species and 44 frugivorous bird species; only ten bird species were part
   of the network core. We witnessed a noteworthy turnover of the species
   comprising the network periphery during migration periods, as opposed to
   the network core, which did not show significant temporal changes in
   species composition. Our results revealed that migration and fruit
   richness explain the temporal variations in network size, connectance,
   nestedness and interaction strength asymmetry. On the other hand, fruit
   abundance only explained connectance and nestedness.
   Discussion. By means of a fine-resolution temporal analysis, we
   evidenced for the first time how temporal changes in the interaction
   network structure respond to the arrival of migratory species into the
   system and to fruit availability. Additionally, few migratory bird
   species are important links for structuring networks, while most of them
   were peripheral species. We showed the relevance of studying bird-plant
   interactions at fine temporal scales, considering changing scenarios of
   species composition with a quantitative network approach.

AB Knowledge of the mechanisms that shape biodiversity is essential to
   understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interacting
   species. Recent studies posit that most of the organization of
   mutualistic networks is shaped by differences in species abundance among
   interacting species. In this study, we examined the mutualism involving
   plants with extrafloral nectaries and their associated ants. We show
   empirically that the difference in abundance among ants on vegetation
   partially explains the network structure of mutualistic interactions and
   that it is independent of ant species compositions: an ant species that
   is abundant usually interacts with more plant species. Moreover, nested
   networks are generated by simple variation in ant abundance on foliage.
   However, in ant-plant mutualistic networks, nestedness was higher than
   in networks describing the occurrence of ants on plants without a food
   resource. Additionally, the plant and ant species with the highest
   number of interactions within these networks interacted more among
   themselves than expected under the assumption of an abundance-based,
   random mixing of individuals. We hypothesize that the dominance of these
   ant species occurs because these ants are able to outcompete other ant
   species when feeding on extrafloral nectaries and because of the
   presence of ecophysiological adaptations to utilize liquid food.

   in a Brazilian savanna and identified the pollinator's other food
   resources. Twenty-three species of pollinators were sampled. Although
   there were temporal variations in visitor frequency, satisfactory levels
   of fruit set were obtained. This temporal variation promoted a
   compensatory effect on plant reproduction as the pollinator species were
   replaced during the course of flowering. The analysis of pollen loads
   showed grains of 16 plant species and four pollen types belonging to
   seven families that formed a network with a nested pattern. Such a
   network suggests that generalist plants must be available in the crop

AB Dynamic population models are based on the Verhulst's equation
   (logisitic equation), where the classic Malthusian growth rate is damped
   by intraspecific competition terms. Mainstream population models for
   mutualism are modifications of the logistic equation with additional
   terms to account for the benefits produced by the interspecies
   interactions. These models have shortcomings as the population
   divergence under some conditions (May's equations) or a mathematical
   complexity that difficults their analytical treatment (Wright's type II
   models). In this work, we introduce a model for the population dynamics
   in mutualism inspired by the logistic equation but cured of divergences.
   The model is also mathematically more simple than the type II. We use
   numerical simulations to study the model stability in more general
   interaction scenarios. Despite its simplicity, our results suggest that
   the model dynamics are rich and may be used to gain further insights in
   the dynamics of mutualistic interactions.

AB Coral reef symbioses are well-established models for studying
   multi-level networks of species interactions that provide nutritional
   benefits to partners. While the contributions of endosymbionts to
   cnidarian hosts have been extensively documented, relatively little is
   known about how exosymbionts contribute to nutrient cycling in coral
   reef cnidarians. We investigated exosymbiotic sources of ammonia and
   their contributions to physiological processes in Caribbean corkscrew
   sea anemones Bartholomea annulata. In laboratory experiments, anemones
   absorbed ammonia from seawater, which significantly enhanced the mitotic
   index of their endosymbiotic microalgae Symbiodinium, while anemone
   shrimp presence alone had no effect. Anemone shrimps excreted ammonia at
   much slower rates than anemones were able to absorb it, indicating that
   shrimp alone were not able to meet host nitrogen demand. Client fishes
   excreted ammonia similar to 10x more rapidly than did associated
   shrimps. On Caribbean coral reefs, anemone shrimps attract diverse
   client fishes through their parasite-cleaning behavior; these fishes
   excrete substantial ammonia near anemones while being cleaned.
   Exosymbiotic anemone shrimps thus may provide nutritional benefits to
   host anemones and microalgae indirectly, through their attraction of
   nitrogen-excreting fishes. This multi-level mutualistic network
   facilitates tight nutrient cycling among diverse species belonging to
   several phyla on coral reefs. While we assessed the rates and benefits
   of nutrient transfer under laboratory conditions, further research is
   needed to quantify the contributions of ammonia and other nutrients from
   client fishes through cleaner shrimps to host sea anemones in the field.

AB To date, few analyses of mutualistic networks have investigated
   successional or seasonal dynamics. Combining interaction data from
   multiple time points likely creates an inaccurate picture of the
   structure of networks (because these networks are aggregated across
   time), which may negatively influence their application in ecosystem
   assessments and conservation. Using a replicated bipartite mutualistic
   network of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal-plant associations,
   detected using large sample numbers of plants and AM fungi identified
   through molecular techniques, we test whether the properties of the
   network are temporally dynamic either between different successional
   stages or within the growing season. These questions have never been
   directly tested in the AM fungal-plant mutualism or the vast majority of
   other mutualisms. We demonstrate the following results: First, our
   examination of two different successional stages (young and old forest)
   demonstrated that succession increases the proportion of specialists
   within the community and decreases the number of interactions. Second,
   AM fungal-plant mutualism structure changed throughout the growing
   season as the number of links between partners increased. Third, we
   observed shifts in associations between AM fungal and plant species
   throughout the growing season, potentially reflecting changes in biotic
   and abiotic conditions. Thus, this analysis opens up two entirely new
   areas of research: 1) identifying what influences changes in plant-AM
   fungal associations in these networks, and 2) what aspects of temporal
   variation and succession are of general importance in structuring
   bipartite networks and plant-AM fungal communities.

AB 1. Bipartite network analyses are increasingly being used to better
   understand mutualistic and antagonistic plant-insect interactions at the
   community level. As a result of taxonomic limitations, it is usually
   very difficult to identify all nodes of a network down to the species
   level and many studies leave some specimens identified as lower
   resolution taxa. Accordingly, we do not know how much a lower resolution
   taxonomic representation changes the network structure compared with a
   representation with all nodes at species level.
   2. The present study aimed to test whether insect-plant networks built
   using different combinations of taxonomic levels can still preserve the
   same basic structure of networks built only with species.
   3. In total, 73 bipartite published interaction networks (mutualistic
   and antagonistic) were selected, which were turned into binary networks
   and reconstructed using the nodes classified as species, genus, family
   or order (representing different levels of classification difficulty).
   The network structures were compared using their binary representations
   mainly using connectance, NODF (Nestedness metric based on Overlap and
   Decreasing Fill) and modularity.
   4. The mutualistic network structure was strongly linearly related to
   the original network structures if all nodes were grouped up to genus
   level. In antagonistic networks, the structure was related to the
   original network only if nodes were only grouped at the species level.
   5. The findings of the present study are especially helpful for
   comparative network studies, such as those assessing the effects of
   environmental gradients. For mutualistic networks, Citizen Science
   programmes can provide useful ecological indicators, even with its
   taxonomic limitations.

AB Pollination by animals contributes to the production of nearly 87.5% of
   the seeds and fruits in the world. Hummingbirds are one of the main
   groups of pollinating birds in the Americas, and they form pollination
   networks with the plants they visit. Few hummingbird-plant networks have
   been studied in tropical dry forest, which is one of the vegetation
   types most affected by deforestation worldwide. In this study, we
   describe the characteristics of the core species of a mutualistic
   hummingbird-plant network in a lowland dry forest located on the Yucatan
   Peninsula of Mexico. The study lasted a full year, from August 2017 to
   June 2018. Using point counts and focal observations, we identified
   three species of hummingbirds that visited eight plant species. The
   network was highly connected and had three modules-one for each
   hummingbird species. The core hummingbird species was Chlorostilbon
   canivetii, and the key plants were Cordia dodecandra, Senna racemosa and
   Psittacanthus mayanus. This hummingbird-plant network is apparently
   driven by water availability, which determines plant phenology, which in
   turn, determines hummingbird activity. In the context of global
   extinction, the conservation of core species will be critical to
   maintain the interactions that support all of the species in the
   network.

AB We consider three plant-pollinator mutualistic networks, including a
   montane forest, a beech forest and a meadow. The plant and the
   pollinator connect by links of interacting strengths between species. We
   obtained cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the degree and the
   strength for the networks. The CDFs of the degree for all species,
   pollinators and plant, follow a power law or a stretched exponential
   function. The CDF of the degree for a meadow food web, MEM food web
   (Mommett 1999), is well fitted by a stretched exponential function.
   However, the CDF of the degree for the montane forest food web, INO food
   web (Inouye and Pkye 1998) and for the beech forest food web, KAT food
   web (Kato et al. 1990) show a power law. The CDFs of the strength also
   follow a power law, except for the CDF of the pollinator for the KAT
   food web. The CDFs of the degree and the strength for mutualistic
   networks depend on the types and the locations of the food webs.

AB In Canada, silky prairie-clover (Dalea villosa var. villosa (Nutt.)
   Spreng) is a nationally rare plant, growing only in sand dunes in
   Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Previous research indicates that this species
   is incapable of self-pollination, making it dependent on insect
   pollinators for successful reproduction. The insect visitor community to
   D. villosa in Spruce Woods Provincial Park (SWPP), Manitoba, was
   documented and compared with that of 13 co-flowering plants that share
   some of its insect visitors. In total, 29 insect taxa were observed
   feeding on nectar or pollen from D. villosa. Hymenoptera were the most
   frequent visitors, comprising 60.7% of the taxa and making 93.5% of all
   visits. The visitation rate per stem to D. villosa (0.0042
   stems.min(-1)) was the second highest of all of the plants with which it
   was compared. The insect visitor diversity was 4.0 (Simpson's reciprocal
   index), and the constancy index was 0.72. The high visitation rate,
   diversity, and constancy to this species may be due to a lack of
   competition for pollinators. Over half of the insect visitor taxa (54%)
   and visits (68%) were by omnivorous insects, as opposed to herbivorous
   ones. This means that there is interconnectivity between a mutualistic
   network involving D. villosa and several antagonistic networks.

AB Both ecological and evolutionary timescales are of importance when
   considering an ecological system; population dynamics affect the
   evolution of species traits, and vice versa. Recently, these two
   timescales have been used to explain structural patterns in
   host-parasite networks, where the evolution of the manner in which
   species balance the use of their resources in interactions with each
   other was examined.
   One of these patterns was nestedness, in which the set of parasite
   species within a particular host forms a subset of those within a more
   species-rich host. Patterns of both nestedness and anti-nestedness have
   been observed significantly more often than expected due to chance in
   host-parasite networks. In contrast, mutualistic networks tend to
   display a significant degree of nestedness, but are rarely anti-nested.
   Within networks with different interaction types, therefore, there
   appears to be a feature promoting non-random structural patterns, such
   as nestedness and anti-nestedness, depending on the interaction types
   involved.
   Here, we invoke the co-evolution of species trait-values when allocating
   resources to interactions to explain the structural pattern of
   nestedness in a mutualistic community. We look at a bipartite,
   multi-species system, in which the strength of an interaction between
   two species is determined by the resources that each species invests in
   that relationship. We then analyze the evolution of these interactions
   using adaptive dynamics.
   We found that the evolution of these interactions, reflecting the
   trade-off of resources, could be used to accurately predict that
   nestedness occurs significantly more often than expect due to chance
   alone in a mutualistic network. This complements previous results
   applying the same concept to an antagonistic network. We conclude that
   population dynamics and resource trade-offs could be important promoters
   of structural patterns in ecological networks of different types.

AB Increasing ocean temperatures have widespread consequences for coral
   reefs, one of which is coral bleaching. We analyzed a global network of
   associations between coral species and Symbiodiniaceae for resistance to
   temperature stress and robustness to perturbations. Null networks were
   created by changing either the physiological parameters of the nodes or
   the structures of the networks. We developed a bleaching model in which
   each link, association, is given a weight based on temperature
   thresholds for specific host-symbiont pairs and links are removed as
   temperature increases. Resistance to temperature stress was determined
   from the response of the networks to the bleaching model. Ecological
   robustness, defined by how much perturbation is needed to decrease the
   number of nodes by 50%, was determined for multiple removal models that
   considered traits of the hosts, symbionts, and their associations.
   Network resistance to bleaching and robustness to perturbations differed
   from the null networks and varied across spatial scales, supporting that
   thermal tolerances, local association patterns, and environment play an
   important role in network persistence. Networks were more robust to
   attacks on associations than to attacks on species. Although the global
   network was fairly robust to random link removals, when links are
   removed according to the bleaching model, robustness decreases by about
   20%. Specific environmental attacks, in the form of increasing
   temperatures, destabilize the global network of coral species and
   Symbiodiniaceae. On a global scale, the network was more robust to
   removals of links with susceptible Symbiodiniaceae than it was to
   removals of links with susceptible hosts. Thus, the symbionts convey
   more stability to the symbiosis than the hosts when the system is under
   an environmental attack. However, our results also provide evidence that
   the environment of the networks affects robustness to link
   perturbations. Our work shows that ecological resistance and robustness
   can be assessed through network analysis that considers specific
   biological traits and functional weaknesses. The global network of
   associations between corals and Symbiodiniaceae and its distribution of
   thermal tolerances are non-random, and the evolution of this
   architecture has led to higher sensitivity to environmental
   perturbations.

AB Seed dispersal is a key process for plant colonization and for the
   establishment of many plant populations in tropical environments. A
   large proportion of all tropical woody plants with fruits and seeds
   depend on frugivorous vertebrates for their dispersal, and frugivorous
   bats are essential for the dispersal of seeds from many tropical plants.
   Many of these plants are important for vegetative regeneration after
   disturbances. Our main goal was to document the process of seed
   dispersal through feces-seed analysis by the bat community among
   semi-deciduous, evergreen, and secondary forests in the 'Huasteca'
   region of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. We hypothesized that bats would
   disperse seeds among all three forest types, and thus predicted that we
   would find seeds from both early and late successional stages in bat
   feces in all three forest types. In each of three replicate sites
   representative of each of these forest types, we trapped bats with
   mist-nets and collected their feces with seeds. A total of 558
   individuals from eight frugivorous bat species were captured. The most
   abundant species were Sturnira ludovici, Glossophaga soricina and
   Artibeus jamaicensis. We documented seeds in bat feces from 16 plant
   species belonging to four families: Moraceae, Piperaceae, Solanaceae,
   and Myrtaceae; 43% were pioneer species, and thus important for the
   initial stages of regeneration, and 37% were species of late
   successional stages. Seeds in bat feces were found in similar
   proportions in all forest types, thus contributing to the regeneration
   of highly deforested habitats in the Huasteca region. To maintain the
   entire mutualistic network between bats and plant species, diverse bat
   communities are important.

AB Bipartite graphs have received some attention in the study of social
   networks and of biological mutualistic systems. A generalization of a
   previous model is presented, that evolves the topology of the graph in
   order to optimally account for a given contact preference rule between
   the two guilds of the network. As a result, social and biological graphs
   are classified as belonging to two clearly different classes. Projected
   graphs, linking the agents of only one guild, are obtained from the
   original bipartite graph. The corresponding evolution of its statistical
   properties is also studied. An example of a biological mutualistic
   network is analyzed in detail, and it is found that the model provides a
   very good fitting of all the main statistical features. The model also
   provides a proper qualitative description of the same features observed
   in social webs, suggesting the possible reasons underlying the
   difference in the organization of these two kinds of bipartite networks.

AB Species interactions are central to the structure and dynamics of
   biological communities. Recently, of particular interest, is the
   analysis of ecological networks where the number of species to species
   interactions vary depending on the degree of specialization. For
   mutualistic networks, species degree has been. suggested to follows a
   power distribution or a truncated power distribution. In this paper, I
   discuss previously estimated parameters and associated model selection
   may be unreliable. I use the likelihood approach and compare the results
   from previous findings and show that the parameter estimates as well as
   model selection results are indeed very different. Furthermore, the
   likelihood approach reveals that many mutualistic networks do not follow
   either power distribution or truncated power distribution. (C) 2007

AB Species-rich tropical communities are expected to be more specialized
   than their temperate counterparts [1-3]. Several studies have reported
   increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics [4-7], whereas
   others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling
   bias [8, 9] or differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the
   direction of the latitudinal Specialization gradient remains
   contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how
   biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed
   dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate,
   and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic
   specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at
   tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely
   related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability,
   suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic
   specialization than historical community stability. Biotic
   specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant
   diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic
   interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low
   plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization
   gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low
   mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher
   tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities.

AB Aim Mutualistic network parameters, such as modularity and nestedness,
   show non-random linkage patterns. Both increase network stability in
   different ways. Modularity hampers extinction cascades, whereas
   nestedness resists network disassembly. We explore these parameters in
   seed-dispersal networks in two archipelagos and the significance of life
   history, habitat, geography and phylogeny as drivers of linkage patterns
   and the applicability of modules as biogeographical entities.
   Location Canaries (Atlantic Ocean) and Galapagos (Pacific Ocean).
   Methods We compiled data on plant-seed disperser interactions from own
   observations and the literature, estimated network parameters describing
   interaction patterns (connectance, nestedness and modularity) and
   constructed a backbone phylogeny for the analyses.
   Results The Canarian network was highly nested but weakly modular,
   whereas the Galapagos network showed the opposite characteristics. Most
   key network species are native and have a favourable conservation
   status. Modularity in the Canaries is correlated with habitats
   (indirectly affected by altitude and orientation), whereas in the
   Galapagos it mainly reflects the functional roles of species.
   Main conclusions The divergent link patterns for the archipelagos imply
   that the highly nested Canarian network is stable against disassembly,
   whereas the modular Galapagos network may show strong resistance against
   extinction cascades. This difference may be driven by the specific
   evolutionary dynamics on the archipelagos.

AB One of the major challenges in ecology is to understand the relative
   importance of neutral- and niche-based processes structuring species
   interactions within communities. The concept of neutral-based processes
   posits that network structure is a result of interactions between
   species based on their abundance. On the other hand, niche-based
   processes presume that network structure is shaped by constraints to
   interactions. Here, we evaluated the relative importance of
   neutral-based process, represented by species' abundance (A) and fruit
   production (F) models, and niche-based process, represented by spatial
   overlap (S), temporal overlap (T) and morphological barrier (M) models,
   in shaping the structure of a bird-seed dispersal network from the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We evaluated the ability of each model,
   singly or in combination, to predict the general structure [represented
   by connectance, nestedness (NODF), weight nestedness (WNODF),
   interaction evenness and complementary specialization] and
   microstructure of the network (i.e., the frequency of pairwise
   interactions). Only nestedness (both NODF and WNODF) was predicted by at
   least one model. NODF and WNODF were predicted by a neutral-based
   process (A), by a combination of niche-based processes (ST and STM) and
   by both neutral- and niche-based processes (AM). NODF was also predicted
   by F and FM model. Regarding microstructure, temporal overlap (T) was
   the most parsimonious model able to predict it. Our findings reveal that
   a combination of neutral- and niche-based processes is a good predictor
   of the general structure (NODF and WNODF) of the bird-seed dispersal
   network and a niche-based process is the best predictor of the network's
   microstructure.
